# **Fitbit Data Analysis**


**Dataset Description:**

The dataset consists of daily Fitbit activity and health logs for 30 users over a period of 60 days, resulting in approximately 1,800 records. Each record includes multiple features such as:



* Activity Metrics: Steps, Calories Burned, Sedentary Minutes, Light/Moderate/Vigorous Active Minutes



* Heart Rate Metrics: Resting Heart Rate, Average Daily Heart Rate



* Sleep Metrics: Sleep Duration, Sleep Efficiency/Score



* Other Data: Distance Walked, Floors Climbed



The dataset provides a comprehensive view of lifestyle habits, activity levels, and wellness indicators that can be analyzed for correlations and trends.



**Insights from Visualizations:**



From the correlation heatmaps, histograms, and regression plots, the following key insights emerged:



1. Steps vs Calories Burned â€“ A strong positive correlation (0.89) was observed, confirming that higher daily activity leads to higher energy expenditure.
2. Active Minutes vs Fitness Score â€“ Users with consistently high active minutes also had higher fitness scores, validating activity as a key driver of overall health.
3. Resting Heart Rate vs Sleep Score â€“ A negative correlation (-0.72) was found; users with higher resting heart rates generally had lower sleep quality.
4. Weekday vs Weekend Activity â€“ Hypothesis testing showed a significant difference (p < 0.01), with users walking more on weekdays compared to weekends.
5. Distribution of Fitness Scores â€“ Most users had scores between 55â€“75, while a few outliers with very high sleep efficiency and active minutes achieved scores above 90.
