Fitbit Data Analysis

Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of daily Fitbit activity and health logs for 30 users over a period of 60 days, resulting in approximately 1,800 records. Each record includes multiple features such as:

‚¶Å	Activity Metrics: Steps, Calories Burned, Sedentary Minutes, Light/Moderate/Vigorous Active Minutes

‚¶Å	Heart Rate Metrics: Resting Heart Rate, Average Daily Heart Rate

‚¶Å	Sleep Metrics: Sleep Duration, Sleep Efficiency/Score

‚¶Å	Other Data: Distance Walked, Floors Climbed

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of lifestyle habits, activity levels, and wellness indicators that can be analyzed for correlations and trends.

Insights from Visualizations:

From the correlation heatmaps, histograms, and regression plots, the following key insights emerged:

1.	Steps vs Calories Burned ‚Äì A strong positive correlation (0.89) was observed, confirming that higher daily activity leads to higher energy expenditure.
2.	Active Minutes vs Fitness Score ‚Äì Users with consistently high active minutes also had higher fitness scores, validating activity as a key driver of overall health.
3.	Resting Heart Rate vs Sleep Score ‚Äì A negative correlation (-0.72) was found; users with higher resting heart rates generally had lower sleep quality.
4.	Weekday vs Weekend Activity ‚Äì Hypothesis testing showed a significant difference (p < 0.01), with users walking more on weekdays compared to weekends.
5.	Distribution of Fitness Scores ‚Äì Most users had scores between 55‚Äì75, while a few outliers with very high sleep efficiency and active minutes achieved scores above 90.
